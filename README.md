<img width="1259" height="1169" alt="Examples" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e96dfb0-c66f-47d8-837f-3efb95fbb7fd" />

<b>Note:</b>
<br/>
As not all the pixels in the resulting image display data of the QR Code, the resulting code requires more perfect conditions in terms of lighting, distance and angle for a successful scan, compared to a simple "boring" qr-code.

<b>Thanks to:</b>
<br/>
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrcode/build/qrcode.min.js for providing the Base QR Code


<b>PS:</b> I'm new to OpenSource Development, so If I am doing something wrong, i'm happy to adapt.
<b>PS2:</b> There's also a barebones Android App, that is just an offline view of the website.
