# Image_2_QR
Generating QR Codes From Images

Demo: https://janglingpointer.github.io/Image_To_QR/

<img width="800" alt="ui_screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba1b71bd-f9f9-4ebf-b736-cb5d68c39a34" />
<img width="800" alt="results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d99d59cb-c4cc-4e72-b878-8ee4e8082d72" />

<b>Note:</b>
<br/>
As not all the pixels in the resulting image display data of the QR Code, the resulting code requires more perfect conditions in terms of lighting, distance and angle for a successful scan, compared to a simple "boring" qr-code.

<b>Thanks to:</b>

<b>PS:</b> I'm new to OpenSource Development, so If I am doing something wrong, i'm happy to adapt.
<b>PS2:</b> There's also a barebones Android App, that is just an offline view of the website.
